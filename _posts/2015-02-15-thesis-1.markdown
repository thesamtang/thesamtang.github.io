Until the completion of this project, these blog posts will mainly focus on some of the more technical aspects of designing and building my thesis installation. However, it's probably important to preface these posts with some of my motivations. I will provide a cursory overview here of the first part of my thesis, which will hopefully give enough context to understand my decisions going forward.

The primary challenge I am attempting to address with my project is a phenomenon known as the "Amherst Awkward". It is a symptom of certain social structures at Amherst which prevents many students from developing strong or lasting personal relationships with each other. I won't go into detail here about the underlying causes of the Amherst Awkward, but know that such a thing does in fact exist and that students are [aware][1] [of][2] [its][3] [effects][4]. I want to target these aspects of student life because they engender a campus community which does not promote cross-cultural dialogue or seek to  understand the experiences of their peers and which I think is ultimately harmful to the student body as a whole. As a student of architecture I believe that existing on-campus public spaces have an untapped potential to bridge some of these social gaps in meaningful ways. Of course, I am not trying to use this project to generalize the student experience at Amherst College in any way, but I have personally encountered some of the issues outlined below and I've found that some of my peers have had similar experiences as well, and I feel that it's an important topic to address.

###Defining Interaction

**Figure 1.** Typical interaction feedback loop between two people

In a typical interaction between two persons A and B, there exists a feedback loop of communication, initiated by some kind of greeting and maintained by conversation or banter (Figure 1). My attempt here at describing an interaction may seem somewhat simplistic at first, but I want to provide a relatively objective basis for which to compare experiences to.

###Effects of the Amherst Awkward

**Figure 2.** Deflection of interactive behavior due to the Amherst Awkward

At Amherst College, this normal flow of interaction is often disrupted by the social barrier created by the Amherst Awkward (Figure 2). Students will choose not to reciprocate an invitation to interact, or both parties will not even attempt to make contact, despite an already existing connection. This behavior manifests itself in multiple ways - students would rather sit alone in the dining halls or not go to the dining hall at all than sit with students they're unfamiliar with, two acquaintances will walk past each other without acknowledging the other or intentionally avoiding eye contact, students who meet during orientation week activities will never speak to each other again before graduating. The barrier is often discussed and administrative attempts to mitigate its effects have mostly failed.

###My Approach

**Figure 3.** The goal: natural (but mediated) interaction in spite of the Amherst Awkward

What I want to achieve through my installation is to mend the disruption in the interaction feedback loop caused by the Amherst Awkward using interactive architecture. Instead of trying to tackle the underlying cultural or administrative causes of the Amherst Awkward, I want to attempt to exaggerate its effects by translating the social barrier between two students who are trying to interact into a physical barrier by placing installations in two places on campus which communicate with each other. I hope that by highlighting the awkwardness or inconvenience created by such barriers, I will be able to create a strong shared experience which can be bonded over.

This is where technology comes in. In order to create such an experience, I will need to construct a responsive environment which reacts to the actions of participants on both ends of the installation. By generating a feedback loop using participant activity as input on one end and some kind of multisensory output on the other end, I hope to simulate natural interactivity. Thus, there are four components of this installation which I need to define and build for. Given spaces A and B, there is A_in, A_out, B_in, and B_out. A_in and B_in will be comprised of sensors which will be used to track participant activity, and A_out and B_out will generate some experience which can be sensed by a participant.

My next post will address the different possibilities for what could be used in each of these four components.
